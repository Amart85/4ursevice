TEAM NAME:- AMAR

INTRODUCTION:-
=============
The main idea for this project comes from the devastating economic impacts of covid-19 on middle class and low income groups.
Many have lost their jobs in private sector and un-organised sector.

Workers in Un-organised sector are mostly day-to-day working earners for their families.

Many teaching faculty in schools and colleges in private sector have turned into cab drivers and auto-drivers to survive.

This app is an effort to connect and bridge the gap between the Customers and the self-employed or service providers, so that those looking for some kind of work or customers will have some opportunity to earn and survive the bad economic times.
